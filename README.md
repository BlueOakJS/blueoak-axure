# BlueOak Axure Libraries

This is the demo site for the [BlueOak](http://blueoak.io/) Axure component library set. These Axure libraries work as a replacement for the default Axure libraries. They mirror the out-of-the-box styles of [Foundation 6 for sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/).

It comes with four libraries:

1. __Widgets:__ A complete, mobile-first replacement of the Axure Default library, containing the entire Foundation component set.

2. __Grids:__ A grid system for phone, tablet (horizontal and vertical), and desktop, plus common device size screens.

3. __Callouts"__ A set of callouts to annotate your wireframes

4. __Flow Charts:__ A redesigned set of flow elements to match your wireframes.
